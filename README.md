An Open Letter to the Linux Community: Hardware Support Is the Last Frontier

This is not a complaint. It’s a rallying cry.

To the Developers, Maintainers, and Leaders of Debian, Red Hat, Arch, and the greater Linux ecosystem:

We, a growing wave of users leaving Windows behind, commend your efforts in creating fast, efficient, and secure operating systems. However, there remains one significant barrier: hardware support.

Across forums and social platforms, countless users voice frustration over missing drivers, inconsistent GPU performance, Wi-Fi issues, and lack of vendor support. While Linux excels in performance and stability, newcomers and average users often struggle with basic hardware functionality — a hurdle that can drive them back to proprietary systems.

In an age where digital freedom is crucial, where Microsoft tightens its grip through mandatory accounts and controversial policies, Linux stands as a beacon of choice and control. But it must be accessible. It must work — out of the box — on more hardware.

We understand the challenges: proprietary firmware, limited documentation, and vendor indifference. Yet, this is a call not just to demand better from hardware makers, but to collaborate, to streamline community-driven driver projects, and to make hardware support a strategic priority.

We urge you to:

Forge partnerships with hardware manufacturers.

Create funding models or bounty programs for driver development.

Offer simplified user tools for troubleshooting and reporting hardware issues.

Embrace unified hardware compatibility initiatives across distributions.

You’ve already won the hearts of developers and enthusiasts. Now is the time to win the desktops of the world.

We are ready to help. Are you ready to lead?

Sincerely,Anons_v69 (hd9618)And the growing wave of everyday Linux usersGitHub Repository → linux-hardware-open-letter
