 Open Letter to the Linux Community ‚Äì On Hardware Support
Title: Linux Needs to Step Up in Hardware Support

Dear Linux Developers and Distributors (especially Debian, Arch, and Red Hat teams),

First and foremost, I extend my sincere appreciation for your continuous dedication to building secure, open, and powerful operating systems. Many of us‚Äîindividuals, professionals, and entire communities‚Äîowe our freedom from monopolized ecosystems to your efforts.

However, I must speak on an issue that has become an undeniable obstacle to the wider adoption of Linux on desktops and laptops: Hardware support, particularly for graphics cards, Wi-Fi modules, and proprietary drivers.

‚ùó The Problem
Users who are migrating from Windows‚Äîespecially those from economically limited regions‚Äîoften do so on older hardware. Many cannot afford newer devices or the luxury of choosing hardware that "just works" with Linux. When they install a Linux distro, they are met with:

Non-functioning Wi-Fi chips

Blank screens due to unsupported GPUs

Lack of automatic driver detection

Frustrating trial-and-error with forums and terminal commands

This is not just a technical hurdle‚Äîit‚Äôs a barrier to entry. One that Windows and macOS users rarely face.

‚öôÔ∏è Suggested Improvements
We‚Äôre not asking for miracles. We‚Äôre asking for:

A centralized Hardware Compatibility Layer across distros

Unified GUI-based driver installers

Better integration with vendors (yes, including proprietary blobs when absolutely necessary)

Improved boot-time detection with clear user feedback

Linux already dominates servers, embedded systems, and cloud environments. It‚Äôs time to prioritize the desktop experience, especially for first-time users.

üåç The Impact
Millions are seeking alternatives to closed systems, surveillance capitalism, and expensive subscriptions. Linux is so close to being the perfect answer‚Äîbut without reliable hardware support, we push users back into the arms of Microsoft and Apple.

Please take this not as criticism, but as an urgent call to refine and simplify the hardware experience for the masses.

With all due respect and admiration,
A passionate user and advocate of open systems.
